FAQ:
1. Error running the app.
   Ans: Check python version via python --version. If you have installed python3 and the python --version gives u the python3 version. Try use python2/py2 instead. Eg. python2 main.py. If it still does not work go to your environmental variables, find the python2 path, move the python2 path to the top.
